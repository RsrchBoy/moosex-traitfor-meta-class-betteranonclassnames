NAME

    MooseX::TraitFor::Meta::Class::BetterAnonClassNames - Metaclass trait
    to *attempt* to demystify generated anonymous class names

VERSION

    This document describes version 0.002003 of
    MooseX::TraitFor::Meta::Class::BetterAnonClassNames - released March
    23, 2017 as part of MooseX-TraitFor-Meta-Class-BetterAnonClassNames.

ATTRIBUTES

 is_anon

    Read-only, Boolean, default: false.

    Provides an attribute in the place of "is_anon" in Class::MOP::Package.

 anon_package_prefix

    Read-only, String

METHODS

 _build_anon_package_prefix

    Builder method for the "anon_package_prefix" attribute.

 _anon_package_middle

    Defines what the "middle" of our anonymous package names is; provided
    for ease of overriding and hardcoded to:

        ::__ANON__::SERIAL::

 _anon_package_prefix

    Returns the full prefix used to generate anonymous package names; if
    called on an instance then returns a sensible prefix (generally class
    name) stashed in "anon_package_prefix"; otherwise returns the result of
    a call to "_anon_package_prefix" in Moose::Meta::Class.

 create

    Set the package name to a nicer anonymous class name if is_anon is
    passed and true and anon_package_prefix is passed and a non-empty
    string.

 create_anon_class

    Create an anonymous class, as via "create_anon_class" in
    Moose::Meta::Class, but with a kinder, gentler package name -- if
    possible.

SUMMARY

    You really want to be looking at "with_traits" in MooseX::Util.
